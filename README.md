# üöê camper

üöê camper is a starter kit for making static websites using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) that can be deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) from a connected Git repository and edited through an admin panel using [Decap CMS](https://www.decapcms.org/).

This project only uses free and/or open-source tools and is (currently) free to deploy to Netlify using their free tier. :-)

## Requirements
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Run `npm ci`

## Usage
- `npm run dev` to run a local development server with live reload (served over `localhost:8080`)
- `npm run build` to build everything (without starting a local server)

By default, Eleventy builds files from `/src` to `/public` (see in `/.eleventy.js`), while Parcel takes `/assets/js/main.js` and `/assets/css/main.sass` as entry points and builds to `/public/assets/js` and `/public/assets/css` accordingly (see or configure in `/package.json`). Before going live, look for the "checkit" comments to customize site names and stuff.
